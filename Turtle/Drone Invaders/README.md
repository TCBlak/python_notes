## Drone Invaders
A *very* basic Space Invaders/Galaga style game made using turtle (and pygame, but only for sound and music).

Atkinson's original is posted on canvas (I think), but this is a lot cleaner code. I can't really tell if it works though, 
because it runs *very* slowly on the school computers.
