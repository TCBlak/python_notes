### Turtle
##### [Turtle documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)

- What is turtle?
  - Imagine you control a robotic turtle (default is actually a black triangle) which moves around on screen. 
  - You draw lines, like a digital etch-a-sketch (but you can lift the "pen" off the screen)
  - For example:
    - Move forward: `turtle.forward(num_pixels)`
    - Turn right: `turtle.right(degrees)`

- For usage of turtle, look in the example programs (Etch is simplest). It's pretty self-explanatory.
